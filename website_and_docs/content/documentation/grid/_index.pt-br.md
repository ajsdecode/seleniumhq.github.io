Selenium Grid allows the execution of WebDriver scripts on remote machines 
by routing commands sent by the client to remote browser instances. 

Grid aims to:

* Provide an easy way to run tests in parallel on multiple machines
* Allow testing on different browser versions
* Enable cross platform testing
